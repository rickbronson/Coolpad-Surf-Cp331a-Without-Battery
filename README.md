  Coolpad Surf cp331a Without Battery
==========================================


  Through experimentation I discovered how to use a Coolpad Surf cp331a without a battery.  I bought the cp331a without a battery only to discover that it will not work without a battery.  I had plenty of old Lithium ion batteries laying around even if they wouldn't physically fit in the thing.  The Samsung battery shown in the picture has a 2.38 Kohm NTC (thermistor) but the cp331a was looking for something around 12 Kohms so I put a 12 Kohm resistor in the place shown in the picture.  It works normally with the battery attached as shown but to get it working without a battery just hold the "ON" button down while plugging it in to USB.
